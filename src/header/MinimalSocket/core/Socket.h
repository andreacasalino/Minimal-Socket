 * @brief Refer to
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsastartup
 * When operating under Windows, any application using sockets need to
 * initialize the WSA data structure. When doing this, the version to use must
 * be specified. This is internally handled, before using any relevant
 * functionality. The WSA data will be automatically cleaned up when the process
 * terminates.
 *
 * This object allows you to specify the WSA version to use. When calling
 * setWsaVersion(...) you can change the WSA version, as this information will
 * be used next time the WSA data will be (automatically and internally)
 * initialized. Clearly, in case the WSA data was already initialized, as a
 * consequence of creating any kind of sockets or using one of the features
 * defined in Address.h, setWsaVersion has actually no effect.
