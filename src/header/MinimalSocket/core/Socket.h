 * @brief Refer to
 * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsastartup
 * In windows, any application using sockets, need to initialize the WSA data
 * structure. When doing this, the version to use must be specified. This will
 * be internally handled by this library, before calling any fucntion that
 * requires the WSA data to be already initialized.
 * The WSA data will be automatically cleaned up when the process terminates.
 *
 * This object allows you specify the WSA version used to initialize the WSA
 * data. When calling setWsaVersion(...) you can change the WSA version and such
 * information will be used next time the WSA data will be (automatically and
 * internally) initialized. Clearly, in case the WSA data was already
 * initialized, as a consequence of creating any kind of sockets or using one of
 * the features defined in Address.h, setWsaVersion has actually no effect.
